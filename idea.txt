so create an application which consists of three sections:

- Telegram Bot
- Web UI
- Backend

Basic idea is that, we use the bot to send voice messages. It gets processed in the backend where we perform a speech to text, and display that to the web ui.

This is the initial idea, but we can probably expand on that.

Tech stack:
- Telegram Bot - JavaScript
- Backend - Node/Express
- Web UI - JavaScript/Svelte???

We may want to incorporate queues (RabbitMQ or Kafka or alternative) at some point
